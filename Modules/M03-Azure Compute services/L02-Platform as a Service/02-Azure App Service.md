*Azure App Service* is a PaaS offering on Azure for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends. 

*Web App*, a component of Azure App Services, is a fully-managed compute platform that is optimized for hosting websites and web applications. You can build applications and run them natively in Windows or Linux environments, and many languages are supported for building your application.

Supported Languages include:

- Node.js
- Java
- PHP
- Python (Preview)
- .NET
- .NET Core
- Ruby

As a PaaS offering, Azure App services offers services such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also utilize its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources. Other capabilities you can utilize include package management, staging environments, custom domain, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.


### Why use App Service?
App Service provides you with some key features, including:

- Multiple languages and frameworks. App Service supports many languages as listed above, and allows you to run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.
- DevOps optimization. You can set up continuous integration and deployment using either Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. You also can promote updates through test and staging environments, and manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).
- Global scale with high availability. Using App Service, you can scale up or out manually or automatically, and host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure. In addition, the App Service service-level agreement (SLA) ensures high availability.
- Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data. Choose from more than 50 connectors for different enterprise systems.
- Security and compliance. App Service is ISO, Service Organization Controls (SOC), and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant. Users can authenticate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), or with social media accounts such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft. Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities.
- Application templates. Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- Microsoft Visual Studio integration. Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
- API and mobile features. App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
- Serverless code. Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Pay only for the compute time your code actually uses.
