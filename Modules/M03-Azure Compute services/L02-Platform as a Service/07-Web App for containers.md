Azure App Service also supports container deployment. The service container hosting service offering in Azure App Service is often referred to as *Web App for Containers*.

Web App for Containers allows customers to use their own containers and deploy them to App Service as a web app. Similar to the Web App solution, Web App for Containers eliminates time-consuming infrastructure management tasks during container deployment, updating, and scaling. This enables developers to focus on coding, and getting their apps in front of end users faster. 

To boost developer productivity, Web App for Containers also provides:

- Integrated CI/CD capabilities with Docker Hub
- Azure Container Registry
- Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)
- Built-in staging
- Rollback
- Testing-in-production
- Monitoring
- Performance testing capabilities

For Operations, Web App for Containers also provides rich configuration features that enable developers to more easily add custom domains, integrate with Azure AD authentication, add SSL certificates, and more. These are all crucial to web app development and management. Web App for Containers is an ideal environment to run web apps that do not require extensive infrastructure control.

Web App for Containers supports both Linux and Windows containers. It also provides the following features:

- Deploy containerized applications using Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, or private registries.
- Incrementally deploy apps into production with deployment slots and slot swaps to allow for blue/green deployments (also known as A/B deployments).
- Scale out automatically with auto-scale.
- Enable application logs, and use the App Service Log Streaming feature to see logs from your application.
- Use PowerShell and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to remotely connect directly into your containers.
