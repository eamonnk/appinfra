We highly recommend that you complete the assigned hands-on lab work. To do the hands-on labs, you will need to complete the following steps. 

1. Sign up for a free [Azure DevOps account](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/). Use the Sign up for a free account button to create your account. If you already have an account proceed to the next step.

2. Sign up for free [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). If you already have an account proceed to the next step.

3. To make it easier to get set up for testing Azure DevOps, a [Azure DevOps Generator Demo](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) program has been created. Click the **Sign In** button and sign in with your Azure DevOps account.

9. When the project is successfully completed, click the link provided to go to your team project within Azure DevOps.

✔️ Note that because Azure DevOps was previously called VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services), some of the existing hands-on labs might refer to VSTS rather than Azure DevOps.
