*Configuration management* refers to  automated management of configuration, typically in the form of version-controlled scripts, for an application and all the environments needed to support it. Configuration management means lighter-weight, executable configurations that allow us to have configuration and environments as code.

> Note: The term *Configuration as Code* can also be used to mean configuration management, however is not used as widely, and in some cases, Infrastructure as Code is used to describe both provisioning and configuring machines. The term *Infrastructure as Code* is also sometimes used to include *Configuration as Code*, but not vice versa.

### Manual configuration versus Configuration as Code

Manually managing the configuration of a single application and environment can be challenging. The challenges are even greater for managing multiple applications and environments across multiple servers. Automated configuration, or treating Configuration as Code, can alleviate some of the challenges associated with manual configuration.

The following table lists the major differences between manual configuration and Configuration as Code.

### Benefits of configuration management
The following list are benefits of configuration management:
- Facilitates auditing and improves traceability
- Allows version-controlled configuration
- Helps detect and correct configuration drift
- Provides code-review and unit-testing capabilities to help manage infrastructure changes
- Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource
- Facilitates automation
- Enables automated scale-up and scale-out
- Provides consistency across environments
