*Ansible* is an open-source platform that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments. Using Ansible, you can provision VMs, containers, and complete cloud infrastructure. In addition to provisioning and configuring applications and their environments, Ansible allows you to automate the deployment and configuration of resources in your environment, such as virtual networks, storage, subnets, and resources groups.

Ansible is designed for multi-tier deployments. Unlike Puppet or Chef, Ansible is *agentless*, so you do not have to install software on the managed machines.

Ansible also models your infrastructure by describing how all of your systems interrelate, rather than managing just one system at a time.
