<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Kubernetes</span></strong></h1>

Kubernetes running in the Azure Container Service has the following characteristics:

- Kubernetes originated with Google.
- Is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing a container-centric infrastructure.
- Kubernetes is the most complex container cluster product of the available products.
- It provides the most options and flexibility.
- Kubernetes can fully manage the underlying cloud infrastructure and natively integrates with Azure resources.
- It can scale up the number of containers in a cluster and also add virtual machines to the agent pool, providing very flexible scaling options.
- Kubernetes manages exposure to the outside world by using the Azure load balancer while deploying a container. This is, it changes its own infrastructure to accommodate workloads. For instance, it can make changes to the load balancer while deploying a container that hosts a web server.


Kubernetes is sometimes referred to as k8s, as an abbreviation. For more details, see &nbsp;<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/whatisk8s/" target="_blank">What is Kubernetes?</a>.
