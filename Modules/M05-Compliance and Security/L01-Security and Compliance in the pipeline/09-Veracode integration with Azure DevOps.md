## Veracode
The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=checkmarx.cxsast" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Veracode</span></a> is another example of an extension that is available on the Azure DevOps Marketplace that you can integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to address Rugged DevOps security related issues. 

The Veracode Application Security Platform is a SaaS that enables developers to automatically scan an application for security vulnerabilities. Veracode provides static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST) and SCA, allowing development teams to assess both first-party code and third-party components for security risk

### Veracode functionality
- **Integrate application security into the development tools you already use**: From within Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server you can automatically scan code using the Veracode Application Security Platform to find security vulnerabilities, import any security findings that violate your security policy as work items, and even optionally stop the build if serious security issues are found.
- **Don't stop for false alarms**: Because Veracode gives you accurate results and prioritize them based on severity, you won’t need to waste resources dealing with hundreds of false positives. We have assessed over 2 trillion lines of code in 15 languages and 70+ frameworks, and we get better with every assessment due to our rapid update cycles and continuous improvement processes. And, if something does get through, just mitigate it using the easy Veracode workflow; we’ll remember it the next time.
- **Align your AppSec practices with your development practices**: Do you have a large or distributed development team? Are you drowning in revision control branches? You can integrate your Azure DevOps workflows with the Veracode *Developer Sandbox*, which supports multiple development branches, feature teams, and other parallel development practices.
- **Don't just find vulnerabilities, fix them**: Veracode gives you remediation guidance with each finding as well as the data path that an attacker would use to reach the weak point in the application. Veracode also highlights the most common sources of vulnerabilities to help prioritize remediation. In addition, when vulnerability reports don’t provide enough clarity, you can set up one-on-one developer consultations with our experts who have backgrounds in both security and software development. Show-stopping security findings show up in your teams' list of work items automatically, and are automatically updated and closed once you scan your fixed code.
- **Proven onboarding process allows for scanning on day one**: Want to get started quickly? The cloud based Veracode Application Security Platform is designed to be instantly on and easy to use so that you can get started in minutes. Veracode's services and support team can get you going quickly and make sure that you are on track to build application security into your process.
