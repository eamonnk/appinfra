1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
>> Azure PowerShell is

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,530
a module that you add
to Windows PowerShell,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,100
or PowerShell Core to let you

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,245
connect to your Azure subscription
on managed resources.

5
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:12,510
Azure PowerShell requires
PowerShell in order to function.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,720
PowerShell provide services
like the shell window,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,115
command parsing and so on.

8
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:20,955
An Azure PowerShell as the
Azure specific commands.

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,645
The base PowerShell product is
available in two different formats.

10
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:27,450
PowerShell on Windows
this comes by default in

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,555
Windows environments
or PowerShell Core.

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,850
A cross-platform version
of PowerShell that

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,920
can be installed
a Windows, Linux, or Mac.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,875
Azure PowerShell is also accessible
via two different methods.

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,540
Firstly, via local install,

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,025
on Windows, Linux, or Mac.

17
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,925
The same as the base
PowerShell product or

18
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:50,180
via any browser using the
Azure Cloud Shell service.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,415
This is a browser-based
management console

20
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:55,340
providing boat a Bash on
the PowerShell experience.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,060
In both cases, Azure PowerShell
can be run either interactively

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,190
issuing commands in
real-time providing input

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,350
as needed or scripted,

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,630
where everything is
predefined then executed.

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,580
Let's look briefly at some of
the core PowerShell components.

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,410
Firstly, there's Cmdlets:

27
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,565
PowerShell command are
just called Cmdlets.

28
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:15,485
Cmdlets follow a verb-noun
naming convention.

29
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:20,675
For example, Get-Process,
format-Table, Start-Service.

30
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:23,695
There's also a convention
for verb choice.

31
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,575
With Get to retrieve data,

32
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,600
Set to insert or update data,

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,265
Format to format data,

34
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:32,405
and Out to direct outputs
to a destination, and more.

35
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:34,790
There also PowerShell modules.

36
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,270
Cmdlets are shipped in modules.

37
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,590
The PowerShell module is a DLL that

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,365
includes the code to process
each available Cmdlets.

39
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:44,270
You load Cmdlets into PowerShell

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,460
by loading the module
they are contained in.

41
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,290
You can obtain additional Cmdlets by

42
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,010
downloading specific modules
and installing them.

43
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,570
For example, the module
specific to Azure

44
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,585
provides the Cmdlets for
interacting with Microsoft Azure.

45
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,760
You can get a list
of loaded modules in

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,600
your PowerShell session using
the Cmdlets Get-module.
