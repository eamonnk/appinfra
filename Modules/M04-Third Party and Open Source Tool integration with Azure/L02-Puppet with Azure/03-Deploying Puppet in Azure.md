Puppet Enterprise lets you automate the entire lifecycle of your Azure infrastructure simply, scalably, and securely, from initial provisioning through application deployment. 

Puppet Enterprise is available to install directly into Azure using the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Azure Marketplace</span></a>. The Puppet Enterprise image allows you to manage up to 10 Azure VMs for free, and is available to use immediately.

After you select it, you need to fill in the VM's parameter values. A preconfigured system will then run and test Puppet, and will preset many of the settings. However, these can be changed as needed. The VM will then be created, and Puppet will run the install scripts.

Another option for creating a Puppet master in Azure is to install a Linux VM in Azure and deploy the Puppet Enterprise package manually.
