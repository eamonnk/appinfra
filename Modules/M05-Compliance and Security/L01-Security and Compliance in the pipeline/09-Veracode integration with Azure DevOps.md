The Veracode Application Security Platform is an SaaS that enables developers to automatically scan an application for security vulnerabilities. Veracode provides static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and SCA, allowing development teams to assess both first-party code and third-party components for security risks.

### Veracode functionality

- Integrate application security into the development tools you already use. From within Azure DevOps and Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) you can automatically scan code using the Veracode Application Security Platform to find security vulnerabilities, import any security findings that violate your security policy as work items, and even optionally stop the build if serious security issues are discovered.

- Don't stop for false alarms: Because Veracode gives you accurate results and prioritizes them based on severity, you won’t need to waste resources responding to hundreds of false positives. Microsoft has assessed over 2 trillion lines of code in 15 languages and over 70 frameworks, and the process improves with every assessment as a result of the rapid update cycles and continuous improvement processes. And, if something does get through, you can mitigate it using the easy Veracode workflow.

- Align your application security practices with your development practices: Do you have a large or distributed development team? Do you have too many revision control branches? You can integrate your Azure DevOps workflows with the Veracode Developer Sandbox, which supports multiple development branches, feature teams, and other parallel development practices.

- Don't just find vulnerabilities, fix them: Veracode gives you remediation guidance with each finding and the data path that an attacker would use to reach the application's weak point. Veracode also highlights the most common sources of vulnerabilities to help you prioritize remediation. In addition, when vulnerability reports don’t provide enough clarity, you can set up one-on-one developer consultations with Microsoft experts who have backgrounds in both security and software development. Security issue's that are found by Vercode, which could prevent you from releasing, show up automatically in your teams' list of work items, and are automatically updated and closed after you scan your fixed code.

- Proven onboarding process allows for scanning on day one. Want to get started quickly? The cloud-based Veracode Application Security Platform is designed to get you going quickly and be easy to use so that you can get started in minutes. Veracode's services and support team can make sure that you are on track to build application security into your process.
