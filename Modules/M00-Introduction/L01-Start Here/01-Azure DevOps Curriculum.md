Welcome to the *Implementing Application Infrastructure* course. This course is part of a series of courses to help you prepare for the AZ-400, [Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-400.aspx) certification exam.

The DevOps certification exam is for DevOps professionals who combine people, process, and technologies to continuously deliver valuable products and services that meet end user needs and business objectives. DevOps professionals streamline delivery by optimizing practices, improving communications and collaboration, and creating automation. They design and implement strategies for application code and infrastructure that allow for continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring and feedback.

Exam candidates must be proficient with Agile practices. They must be familiar with both Azure administration and Azure development, and be experts in at least one of these areas. Azure DevOps professionals must be able to design and implement DevOps practices for version control, compliance, infrastructure as code, configuration management, build, release, and testing by using Azure technologies.

In particular, make sure you complete the *Design a DevOps Strategy* course to get an overview of DevOps before you learn about specific methodologies.
