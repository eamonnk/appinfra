From here you can integrate specialist security products into your Azure DevOps pipeline. Having a full suite of extensions that allow seamless integration into Azure DevOps pipelines is invaluable.

## WhiteSource

The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.whitesource" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">WhiteSource</span></a> extension is available on the Azure DevOps Marketplace. Using WhiteSource, you can integrate extensions with your CI/CD pipeline to address Rugged DevOps security-related issues. For a team consuming external packages, the WhiteSource extension specifically addresses open source security, quality, and license compliance concerns. Because most breaches today target known vulnerabilities in common components, robust tools are essential to securing problematic open source components.

### Continuously detect all open-source components in your software

WhiteSource will automatically detect all open-source components—including their transitive dependencies—every time you run a build. This means you can generate a comprehensive inventory report within minutes based on the last build you ran. It also gives your security, DevOps, and legal teams full visibility into your organization’s software development process.

### Receive alerts on open-source security vulnerabilities

When a new security vulnerability is discovered, WhiteSource automatically generates an alert and provides targeted remediation guidance. This can include links to patches, fixes, relevant source files, even recommendations to change system configuration to prevent exploitation.

### Automatically enforce open-source security and license compliance policies

According to a company’s policies, WhiteSource automatically approves, rejects, or triggers a manual approval process every time a new open-source component is added to a build. Developers can set up policies based on parameters such as security-vulnerability severity, license type, or library age. When a developer attempts to add a problematic open source component, the service will send an alert and fail the build.

For searching online repositories such as GitHub and Maven Central, WhiteSource also offers an innovative browser extension. Even before choosing a new component, a developer can see its security vulnerabilities, quality, and license issues, and whether it fits their company’s policies.
