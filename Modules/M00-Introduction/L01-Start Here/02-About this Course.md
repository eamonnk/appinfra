### Course Description

The Implementing Application Infrastructure course provides students with knowledge and skills for deploying an application infrastructure in DevOps pipelines.

Students will learn how to implement Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management, how to provision Azure infrastructure using common automation tools, and how to deploy an application infrastructure using various Azure services and deployment methodologies. Students will also learn how to integrate 3rd party deployment tools with Azure, such as *Chef* and *Puppet*, for incorporating compliance and security into release pipelines.
