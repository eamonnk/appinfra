Initiatives work alongside policies in Azure Policy. An *initiative definition* is a set of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for meeting large-scale compliance goals. Even if you have a single policy, we recommend using initiatives if you anticipate increasing your number of policies over time. The application of an initiative definition to a specific scope is called an *initiative assignment*.

### Initiative definitions

Initiative definitions simplify the process of managing and assigning policy definitions by grouping sets of policies into a single item. For example, you can create an initiative named *Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center* to monitor security recommendations from Azure Security Center. Under this example initiative, you would have the following policy definitions:

- Monitor unencrypted SQL Database in Security Center. This policy definition monitors unencrypted SQL databases and servers.
- Monitor OS vulnerabilities in Security Center. This policy definition monitors servers that do not satisfy a specified OS baseline configuration.
- Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Security Center. This policy definition monitors servers without an endpoint protection agent installed.

### Initiative assignments

Like a policy assignment, an *initiative assignment* is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope. Initiative assignments reduce the need to make several initiative definitions for each scope. Scope can range from a management group to a resource group. You can assign initiatives in the same way that you assign policies.
