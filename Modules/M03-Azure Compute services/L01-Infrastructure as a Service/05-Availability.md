Availability in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services in Azure is provided both through the core physical structural components of Azure (such as Azure regions, and Availability Zones), and also through logical components that together provide for overall availability during outages, maintenance, and other downtime scenarios. 


### Availability sets
Availability sets ensure that the VMs you deploy on Azure are distributed across multiple, isolated hardware clusters. Doing this ensures that if a hardware or software failure within Azure happens, only a subset of your VMs are impacted and your overall solution remains available and operational.


Availability sets are made up of update domains and fault domains:


- Update domains. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains. Sequencing updates using update domains ensures that the entire datacenter isn't unavailable during platform updates and patching. Update domains are a *logical* section of the datacenter, and they are implemented with software and logic.

- Fault domains. Fault domains provide for the physical separation of your workload across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in the server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers is affected by the outage.

### Update management
You can also leverage the Update management service within a Windows or Linux VM to manage updates and patches for the VMs. Directly from your VM, you can quickly assess the status of available updates, schedule required updates installation, and review deployment results to verify updates were applied successfully.

#### Enable update management
To enable **Update management** for your VM:
1. On the left side of the screen in the **Azure Portal**, select **Virtual machines**.
2. select a VM From the list.
3. On the VM screen, in the **Operations **section, click **Update management**. The **Enable Update Management **window opens.

If any of the following prerequisites were found to be missing during onboarding, they're automatically added:
- *Log Analytics workspace*. Provides a single location to review and analyze data  generated by the VM features and services, such as update management.
- *Automation*. allows you to run runbooks against VMs, such as download and apply updates.
- *A Hybrid runbook worker* is enabled on the VM. Used to communicate with the VM and obtain information about the update status.
