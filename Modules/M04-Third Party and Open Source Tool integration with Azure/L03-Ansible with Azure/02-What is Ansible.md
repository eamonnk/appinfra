**Ansible** is an open-source platform that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments. Using Ansible, you can provision virtual machines, containers, and complete cloud infrastructure. Aswell as provisioning and configuring applications and their environments, **Ansible** allows you to automate the deployment and configuration of resources in your environment, such as Virtual networks, storage, subnets, resources groups and more. 

**Ansible** is designed for multi-tier deployments and, unlike Puppet or Chef, Ansible is **agent-less**, so you do not have to install software on the managed machines.

**Ansible** also models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.
