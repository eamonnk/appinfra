### Checkmarx functionality
Checkmarx functionality includes:

- Best fix location. Checkmarx highlights the best place to fix your code to minimize the time required to remediate the issue. A visual chart of the data flow graph indicates the ideal location in the code to address multiple vulnerabilities within the data flow using a single line of code.
- Quick and accurate scanning. Checkmarx helps reduce false positives, adapt the rule set to minimize false positives, and understand the root cause for results.
- Incremental scanning. Using Checkmarx, you can test just the code parts that have changed since last code check in. This helps reduce scanning time by more than 80 percent. It also enables you to incorporate the security gate within your continuous integration pipeline.
- Seamless integration. Checkmarx works with all integrated development environments (IDEs), build management servers, bug tracking tools, and source repositories.
- Code portfolio protection. Checkmarx helps protect your entire code portfolio, both open source and in-house source code. It analyzes open-source libraries, ensuring licenses are being adhered to, and removing any open-source components that expose the application to known vulnerabilities. In addition, Checkmarx Open Source helps provide complete code portfolio coverage under a single unified solution with no extra installations or administration required.
- Easy to initiate Open Source Analysis. Enhancing your code portfolio risk assessment coverage is just a few mouse clicks away. With Checkmarxâ€™s Open Source analysis, you don't need additional installations or multiple management interfaces; you simply turn it on, and within minutes a detailed report is generated with clear results and detailed mitigation instructions. Analysis results are designed with the developer in mind. No time is wasted  trying to understand the required action items to mitigate detected security or compliance risks.
