Function as a service (FaaS) is an industry programming model that uses Functions to help achieve serverless compute. These functions have the following characteristics:


- Single responsibility. Functions are single purposed, reusable pieces of code that process an input and return a result. 

- Short-lived. Functions don't stick around when they've finished executing, which frees up resources for further executions.

- Stateless. Functions don't hold any persistent state and don't rely on the state of any other process.

- Event driven and scalable. Functions respond to predefined events and are instantly replicated as many times as needed.
