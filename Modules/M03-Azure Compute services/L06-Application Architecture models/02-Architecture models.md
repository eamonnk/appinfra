An architecture model, or *styles*, is a definition of how applications and the services and data they consume and output are structured. Architectures are not necessarily absolute, but provide guidance on how you can optimize and develop applications.

Architecture models don't require the use of particular technologies, but some technologies are well-suited for certain architectures. For example, containers are a natural fit for microservice applications.
