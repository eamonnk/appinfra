*HashiCorp Terraform* is an open-source tool that allows you to provision, manage, and version cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describes the topology of cloud resources such as VMs, storage accounts, and networking interfaces.

Terraform's command-line interface (CLI) provides a simple mechanism to deploy and version the configuration files to Azure or any other supported cloud service. The CLI also allows you to validate and preview infrastructure changes before you deploy them. 

Terraform also supports multi-cloud scenarios. This means it enables developers to use the same tools and configuration files to manage infrastructure on multiple cloud providers.

You can run Terraform interactively from the CLI with individual commands, or non-interactively as part of a continuous integration pipeline.

There is also an enterprise version of Terraform available, **Terraform Enterprise**.
