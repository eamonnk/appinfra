1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
>> The Azure CLI is
a command line program

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:04,110
that you can use to connect to

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,650
Azure and to execute administrative
commands on Azure resources.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,940
It runs on Linux,

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,470
Mac OS, and Windows,

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,590
and can also be used from a browser
through the Azure Cloud Shell.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,520
Commands in the CLI are structured by

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,545
groups, sub-groups, and commands,

9
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:21,510
and we can see that layout
at the top level by

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,650
running the command Az--help.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,160
We can see what's available under

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,875
the Az group by scrolling
through the help output.

13
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,725
Here's the subgroups which
represent the Azure services,

14
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,630
and we could see services
such as app service,

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,885
IoT, VM, Web App, and many others.

16
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:39,565
By scrolling down through
the command section,

17
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,020
we see the commands available
to act on the group Az,

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,305
such as configure, find,
login, and others.

19
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,225
As you construct the commands,

20
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,520
each group represents
a service provided by Azure.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,260
Under subgroups, divide commands for

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,830
these services into
logical groupings.

23
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,920
For example, let's look at

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,970
the Az vm group by running
the command az vm --help.

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,845
The Az Vm group contains subgroups
including availability set,

26
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,470
disk, image, nic and others.

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,960
As commands including
create, list and restart.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,970
So, to restart a virtual machine
using the Azure CLI,

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,650
we would have a command
something like the following;

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,540
where az vm is the group

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,610
acting on the Azure
Virtual Machine service.

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,555
Restart is the command your
issuing against the group.

33
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,410
Then, there are two parameter values

34
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,050
that would be required
in this command,

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,160
for Resource Group and
Virtual Machine name.

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,750
The Azure CLI can be
used interactively,

37
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,250
issuing commands in realtime,

38
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,360
providing input as
needed or scripted,

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,470
where everything is
predefined then executed.
