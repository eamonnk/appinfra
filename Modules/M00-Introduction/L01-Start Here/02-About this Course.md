**Course Description**
This course provides knowledge and skills to deploy an application infrastructure in DevOps pipelines. Students will learn how to implement infrastructure as code and configuration management, how to provision Azure infrastructure using common automation tools, and how to deploy an application infrastructure using various Azure services and deployment methodologies. Students will also learn how to integrate 3rd party deployment tools with Azure, such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Terraform to incorporate compliance and security into the release pipeline.

**Level**: Intermediate

**Audience**
Students in this course are interested in implementing infrastructure as code or configuration management methodologies and techniques with Azure and release pipelines with Azure DevOps, or in passing the Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions certification exam. 

**Prerequisites**

* Students should  have fundamental knowledge about Azure, experience with virtual machines and containers, and some exposure to automation and scripting.

* Experience working in a software development or operations environment with either Windows or Linux would be helpful but is not essential. 

* Students should also have knowledge of general application development and deployment processes.

**Expected learning objectives**

After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Apply infrastructure and configuration as code principles
* Deploy and manage infrastructure using Microsoft automation technologies such as ARM templates, PowerShell, and Azure CLI
* Implement Azure Automation services and tools, such as runbooks, workflows and update management
* Implement Azure automation state configuration (DSC)
* Understand the use cases and implement various compute services available on across IaaS, Paas, FaaS as well as Azure Service Fabric and Azure Kubernetes Service
* Understand application architecture models and how to choose an appropriate compute service for deploying your application
* Deploy and configure infrastructure and state by integrating third party tools and services with Azure, such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Cloud-init and Terraform
* Understand Rugged DevOps and the principles and methodologies for integrating security into release pipelines
* Identify and implement Azure DevOps extensions with release pipelines to deliver on package management approval and code scanning principles
* Implement Azure security services and toolsets to enhance infrastructure and pipeline security with tools such as Azure Security center, Azure Policy, Key Vault, role-based access control and more.
