*Terraform* by Hashicorp is an open-source tool that allows you to provision, manage and version cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking interfaces.

Terraform's Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a simple mechanism to deploy and version your configuration files to Azure or any other supported cloud. The Terraform CLI also allows for the validation and preview of infrastructure changes before they are deployed.

Terraform also supports multi-cloud scenarios. Multi-cloud support enables developers to use the same tools and configuration files to manage infrastructure on multiple cloud providers.

Terraform can be run interactively form the CLI with individual commands or non-interactively as part of a Continuous Integration Pipeline.

There is also an enterprise version of Terraform available, called *Terraform Enterprise*.
