### Things to know before you begin

To complete these practical exercises you will require the following:
- a Microsoft Account
- an Azure subscription

### Setup

1. If you already have a Microsoft account that has not already been used to sign up for a free Azure trial subscription, you’re ready to get started. If not, don’t worry, just [create a new Microsoft account](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-msa)

2. After you’ve created a Microsoft account, create your [free Microsoft Azure account](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-az2). You’ll need to sign-in with your Microsoft account if you’re not already signed in. Then you’ll need to:
    - Enter your cellphone number and have Microsoft send you a text message to verify your identity.
    - Enter the code you have been sent to verify it.
    - Provide valid payment details. This is required for verification purposes only – your credit card won’t be charged for any services you use during the trial period, and the account is automatically deactivated at the end of the trial period unless you explicitly decide to keep it active.  For more information, see the [frequently asked questions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/) on the Azure sign-up page.

### Updates to Azure

Like many other cloud infrastructure platforms today, updates to Azure services and components are being developed continually. If you've had your own subscriptions for any length of time, you are already aware that changes to services happen much more rapidly than with more traditional application deployment models.

Every effort will be made to update course content where there are major changes to product functionality. However, there will be occasions where course content does not exactly match the latest version of the product. In most cases, you should still be able to understand the tasks and complete the course. The general guidance from the Azure documentation teams is to check the documentation frequently to see what upcoming notifications have been posted or where documentation has been updated to reflect the latest changes.

We encourage you to consult [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/) updates as a starting point for the latest information about updates. From there, you can avail yourself of blogs and other resources that are provided in order to help you stay current in a cloud-enabled world.
