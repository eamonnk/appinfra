00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
>> Configuration management refers to

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,005
the automated management
of configuration,

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,420
typically in the form of
version control scripts for

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,160
an application on
all the environments

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,930
and infrastructure
needed to support it.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,780
Configuration management
means lighter weight,

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,000
executable configurations
that allow us

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,745
to have configuration on
environment scripted and automated.

9
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,340
For instance, adding
a new port to a firewall,

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,080
should be done by editing a text file

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,550
and running the release pipeline,

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,120
not by remoting into the environment
and spending on app manually.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,100
Generally, managing the configuration

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,215
of one application in
an environment can be challenging.

15
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,500
So, scaling this out for
applications across multiple servers

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,850
is very difficult to do

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,070
without using the Configuration
as Code type model.

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,340
A quick comparison of
manual deployments versus

19
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,610
deployments through a Configuration
as Code type model include;

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,440
bugs being more easily reproduced

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,060
with a Configuration
as Code type model.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,470
Configuration as Code providing

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,590
better traceability and
a means of auditing changes.

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,445
Consistent configuration.

25
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:55,775
Configuration as Code
being less error prone.

26
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:59,240
Increased deployment cadence,
less documentation needed and

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,740
needing to be maintained as

28
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,140
all configuration is
available in scripts.

29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,175
It's easier to scale with
automatic configuration.

30
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,710
Also, just be aware that

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,170
the term Configuration as
Code is not used widely.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,590
More widely used is
configuration management.

33
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,380
In some cases, Infrastructure
as Code is used to

34
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,140
describe both provisioning and
the configuration of environments.
