>>Complete the following sentence. Creating multiple Azure Automation Accounts can minimize risks by... ?>>
[[
closing your Azure Automation Account.
(segregating and limiting the scope of access to the resources within your solution.)
deactivating the 'Create Azure Run As account' option.
signing in without subscription-owner access privileges.
]]

[explanation]
Segregating and limiting the scope of access to the resources within your solution, is the correct answer.

All other answers are incorrect answers.

Creating multiple Azure Automation Accounts will not result in closing your Azure Automation Account, deactivating the 'Create Azure Run As account option, or signing in without subscription-owner access privileges.

To minimize risks, it is recommended that you create multiple Automation Accounts. Creating multiple Automation Accounts helps to segregate and limit the scope of access to the resources within your solution. For example, you might use one Automation Account for development, another for production, and another for your on-premises environment. To start using the Azure Automation service, you must first create an Azure Automation Account. You need at least one Azure Automation Account to use Azure Automation. As a safeguard, subscription-owner access is required to add an Azure Automation Account. The 'Create Azure Run As account' option must also be enabled to create an Azure Automation Account.
