**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** is Microsoft's implementation of Kubernetes. AKS makes it simple to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure and reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure.


AKS manages much of the Kubernetes resources for the end user, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand, without taking your applications offline.

Azure AKS manages the following aspects of a Kubernetes cluster for you:

- Handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for you, such as Kubernetes version upgrades and patching.
- Performs simple cluster scaling.
- Enables master nodes to be fully managed by Microsoft.
- You only manage and maintain the agent nodes
- AKS is free, and you only pay only running agent nodes. The master nodes are free.
