Azure offers a number of ways to host your application code. The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on.

### Flowchart

The following flowchart will help you to choose a compute service for your application. The flowchart guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation. As every application has unique requirements, you should treat the flowchart recommendations as a starting point.

### Additional factors affecting your choice of Azure compute service

When choosing a compute service for your application, you may wish to perform a detailed evaluation by considering the following factors.

- Feature set
- [Service limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- [Cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/)
- [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/)
- [Regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
- Developer ecosystem and team skills
- [Compute comparison tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-comparison)

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate two or more compute services.
