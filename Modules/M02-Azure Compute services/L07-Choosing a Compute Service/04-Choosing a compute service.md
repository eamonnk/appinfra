Azure offers a number of ways to host your application code. The term compute refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. The following flowchart will help you to choose a compute service for your application. The flowchart guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation.

Treat this flowchart as a starting point. Every application has unique requirements, so use the recommendation as a starting point. Then perform a more detailed evaluation, looking at aspects such as:
- Feature set
- Service limits
- Cost
- SLA
- Regional availability
- Developer ecosystem and team skills
- Compute comparison tables

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate two or more compute services.
