Azure offers a number of ways to host your application code. The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. 

The following flowchart will help you to choose a compute service for your application. It guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../Linked_Image_Files/decisiontree.png" alt="flowchart outlining decision process when determining an appropriate compute service to use for you application and particular requirements."></p>

Treat this flowchart as a starting point. Every application has unique requirements, so use the recommendation as a starting point. Then perform a more detailed evaluation, looking at aspects such as:

- Feature sets
- Service limits
- Cost
- SLA
- Regional availability
- Developer ecosystem and team skills
- Compute comparison tables

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution might incorporate two or more compute services.
