### Usage scenarios

Azure Key Vault capabilities and usage scenarios include:

- Secrets management. You can use Key Vault to securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
- Key management. As a key management solution, Key Vault makes it easy to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
- Certificate management. Key Vault lets you provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/ Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for your Azure subscription and connected resources more easily.
- Store secrets backed by Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Secrets and keys can be protected either by software, or by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

### Key Vault benefits

The benefits of using Key Vault include:

- Centralized application secrets. Centralizing storage for application secrets allows you to control their distribution, and reduces the chances that secrets might be accidentally leaked.
- Securely stored secrets and keys. Azure uses industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and HSMs, to ensure that access requires proper authentication and authorization.
- Monitor access and use. Using Key Vault, you can monitor and control access to company secrets.
- Simplified administration of application secrets. Key Vault makes it easier to enroll and renew certificates from public Certificate Authorities (CAs). You can also scale up and replicate content within regions, and use standard certificate management tools.
- Integrate with other Azure services. You can integrate Key Vault with storage accounts, container registries, event hubs, and many more Azure services.
