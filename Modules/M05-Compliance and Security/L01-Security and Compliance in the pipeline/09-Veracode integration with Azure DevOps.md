<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Veracode.veracode-vsts-build-extension" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Veracode</span></a> is another example of an **Azure DevOps Marketplace** extension that you can integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to address Rugged DevOps security-related issues. 

The *Veracode Application Security Platform* is a SaaS that enables developers to automatically scan an application for security vulnerabilities. The static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and software composition analysis (SCA) capabilities provided by Veracode allow development teams to assess both first-party code and third-party components for security risks.

### Veracode functionality

Veracode's functionality includes the following features:

- Integrate application security into the development tools you already use. From within Azure DevOps and Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) you can automatically scan code using the Veracode Application Security Platform to find security vulnerabilities. With Veracode you can import any security findings that violate your security policy as work items. Veracode also gives you the option to stop a build if serious security issues are discovered.

- No stopping for false alarms: Because Veracode gives you accurate results and prioritizes them based on severity, you do not need to waste resources responding to hundreds of false positives. Microsoft has assessed over 2 trillion lines of code in 15 languages and over 70 frameworks, and the process improves with every assessment as a result of rapid update cycles and continuous improvement processes. And, if something does get through, you can mitigate it using the easy Veracode workflow.

- Align your application security practices with your development practices: Do you have a large or distributed development team? Do you have too many revision control branches? You can integrate your Azure DevOps workflows with the Veracode Developer Sandbox, which supports multiple development branches, feature teams, and other parallel development practices.

- Find vulnerabilities and fix them too: Veracode gives you remediation guidance with each finding and the data path that an attacker would use to reach the application's weak point. Veracode also highlights the most common sources of vulnerabilities to help you prioritize remediation. In addition, when vulnerability reports do not provide enough clarity, you can set up one-on-one developer consultations with Microsoft experts who have backgrounds in both security and software development. Security issues that are found by Vercode, which could prevent you from releasing, show up automatically in your teams' list of work items, and are automatically updated and closed after you scan your fixed code.

- Proven onboarding process allows for scanning on day one. Want to get started quickly? The cloud-based Veracode Application Security Platform is designed to get you going quickly. It is easy to use, so that you can get started in minutes. Veracode's services and support team can make sure that you are on track to build application security into your process.
