Azure Atomation assets are resources (settings) that are globally available to be used in or associated with a runbook. There are currently six asset categories: **Schedules**, **Modules**, **Certificates**, **Connections**, **Variables**, and **Credentials**.

As a best practice, you should always try to create global assets so that they can be used across your runbooks. This will save time and reduce the number of manual edits within individual runbooks.
