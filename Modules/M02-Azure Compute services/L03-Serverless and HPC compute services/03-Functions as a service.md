Functions as a service (FaaS) is a industry programming model that uses *Functions* to try achieve serverless compute. Those functions have the following characteristics:



- *Single responsibility*: Functions are single purposed, re-susable pieces of code that process an input and return a result. 

- *Short-lived*: Functions don't stick around when finished executing, freeing up resources for further executions

- *Stateless*: Functions don't hold any persistent state and don't rely o the state of any other process

- *Event drive and scalable*: Functions respond to pre-defined events and ar instantly replicated as many times as needed
