The <a href="https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Secure DevOps Kit for Azure</span></a> (AzSK) is a collection of scripts, tools, extensions, automations, and other items that cater to the end-to-end Azure subscription. It resources security needs for DevOps teams, using extensive automation and security integration into native DevOps workflows. 

The Secure DevOps Kit for Azure helps secure DevOps by:

- **Helping secure the subscription**. A secure cloud subscription provides a core foundation upon which to conduct development and deployment activities. An engineering team can deploy and configure security in the subscription by using alerts, ARM policies, RBAC, Security Center policies, JEA, and Resource Locks. Likewise, it can verify that all settings are in conformance with a secure baseline.
- **Enabling secure development**. During the coding and early development stages, developers need to write secure code and then test the secure configuration of their cloud applications. Similar to build verification tests (BVTs), AzSK introduces the concept of security verification tests (SVTs), which can check for security of various resource types in Azure.
- **Integrating security into CI/CD**. Test automation is a core tenet of DevOps. Secure DevOps provides the ability to run SVTs as part of the Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline. You can use these SVTs to ensure that the target subscription used to deploy a cloud application and the Azure resources the application is built upon are all set up in a secure manner.
- **Providing continuous assurance**. In the constantly changing DevOps environment, it's important to move away from the mindset of security being a milestone. Security needs to be viewed as a continuously varying state of a system. This is possible through Secure DevOps capabilities that enable continuous assurance using a combination of  tools such as automation runbooks and schedules.
- **Alerting & monitoring**. Security status visibility is important for both individual application teams and central enterprise teams. Secure DevOps provides solutions that cater to the needs of both. Moreover, the solution spans across all stages of DevOps, in effect bridging the security gap between the dev team and the ops team through the single, integrated views it generates.
- **Governing cloud risks**. Underlying all activities in the Secure DevOps kit is a telemetry framework that generates events such as capturing usage, adoption, and evaluation results. This enables you to make measured improvements to security, targeting areas of high risk and maximum usage.

You can leverage and utilize the tools, scripts, templates, and best practice documentation available as part of this AzSK.
