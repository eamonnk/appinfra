*Azure Cloud Shell* is a browser-based scripting environment for interacting with Azure. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, and is accessible from anywhere using the latest versions of the following browsers:

- Microsoft Edge
- Microsoft Internet Explorer
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while Windows users can opt for PowerShell.

You must have a storage account to use the Cloud Shell and you will be prompted to create one when accessing Azure Cloud Shell.
