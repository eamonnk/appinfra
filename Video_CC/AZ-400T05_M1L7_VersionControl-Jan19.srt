00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
>> To fully implement infrastructure
and configuration as code,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,345
the application code of scripts,

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:07,680
definitions,text files and other

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
related files that are required for

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,030
deployment and configuration
must be version controlled.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,330
Version Control has
the following characteristics:

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,760
Provides for accessing
version differences,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,715
so, ways to visualize
differences between versions.

9
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:23,465
Provides traceability,
so, ways to see

10
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:26,870
versions and check in history
at any given point in time,

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,795
including who made the
changes and what was changed.

12
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:33,440
Provide branching, which allows
for work to be done in parallel

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,810
and in a distributed manner
through merges and branches,

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,595
modern Dev teams can
be pretty global.

15
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,240
In DevOps, both
the Development Team and

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,665
the Operations Team should be
using the same source control.

17
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,735
Everything should be
source controlled,

18
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:51,635
including source code,
environmental definitions,

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,925
infrastructure configuration,
deployment scripts,

20
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,320
documentation, and tests such

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,255
as unit tests and
integration tests etc.

22
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,935
In short, everything.

23
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,065
So that Dev and Ops
can work together,

24
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,520
run a particular version through

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,960
the deployment pipeline and get what

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,660
you're expecting each
time without error.

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,730
Some best practices for
working with Version Control

28
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,350
include: Setting up
an appropriate branching strategy.

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,290
A general role is to promote
the simplest branching strategy

30
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,655
possible to keep maintenance
low on sustainability high.

31
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,220
Connecting work to code.

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,490
An easy way to verify
that the applied code has

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,830
value and is related to
work on the backlog,

34
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,860
writing in code that does not
tie back to any work items,

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,040
is by linking work items
to code changes so that

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,270
metadata is kept with

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,530
the changes and then would
build in deployment.
