The ability to have a full suite of extensions to allow seamless integration into Azure DevOps pipelines is invaluable.




## Whitesource
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.whitesource" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">WhiteSource</span></a> is one such example of an extension that is available on the Azure DevOps Marketplace that you can integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to address Rugged DevOps security related issues. 

For a team consuming external packages, the **WhiteSource Extension** specifically addresses the questions of open source security, quality and license compliance. In a world where most breaches target known vulnerabilities in known components, this is essential hygiene for consuming open source. We’ll discuss some of its capabilities.

### Continuously Detects All Open Source Components in Your Software 
Whitesource will automatically detect all open source components—including their transitive dependencies, every time you run a build. This means you can generate a comprehensive inventory report within minutes, based on the last build you ran, as in the screenshot below. It also gives your security, DevOps and legal teams full visibility into your organization’s software development process.

### Alerts on Open Source Security Vulnerabilities and Their Fixes
When a new security vulnerability is discovered, WhiteSource automatically generates an alert and provides targeted remediation guidance, as in the screenshot below. This can include links to patches, fixes, relevant source files and even recommendations to change system configuration to prevent exploitation.

### Automatically Enforces Open Source Security and License Compliance Policies
According to a company’s policies, WhiteSource automatically approves, rejects or triggers a manual approval process every time a new open source component is added to a build. Developers can set up policies based on parameters such as security-vulnerability severity, license type or library age. As soon as a developer attempts to add a problematic open source component, the service will send an alert and fail the build.

For searching online repositories such as GitHub and Maven Central, WhiteSource also offers an innovative browser extension. Even before choosing a new component, a developer can see its security vulnerabilities, quality, and license issues, and whether it fits a company’s policy.
