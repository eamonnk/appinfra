*Big data* architecture is designed to manage ingestion, processing, and analysis of data that is too large or complex for traditional database systems.

Big data solutions typically involve one or more of the following types of workloads:

- Batch processing of big data sources at rest
- Real-time processing of big data in motion
- Interactive exploration of big data
- Predictive analytics and machine learning

### When to use this architecture
You should consider this architecture for:

- Storing and processing data in volumes too large for a traditional database.
- Transforming unstructured data for analysis and reporting.
- Capturing, processing, and analyzing unbounded streams of data in real time, or with low latency.
- Using Azure Machine Learning or Microsoft Cognitive Services.

### Benefits
The benefits of this technology are:

- Technology choices. You can mix and match Azure-managed services and Apache technologies in HDInsight clusters to capitalize on existing skills or technology investments.
- Performance through parallelism. Big data solutions utilize parallelism, which enables you to use high-performance solutions that scale to large volumes of data.
- Elastic scale. All of the components in the big data architecture support scale-out provisioning, so that you can adjust your solution to small or large workloads, and pay only for the resources that you use.
- Interoperability with existing solutions. The components of the big data architecture are also used for IoT processing and enterprise BI solutions. This enables you to create an integrated solution across data workloads.
