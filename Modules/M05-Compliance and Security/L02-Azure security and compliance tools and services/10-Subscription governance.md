When creating and managing subscriptions: *Billing*, *Access Control* and *Subscription limits*, there are three main aspects to consider: 

- Billing. Billing reports can be generated by subscriptions. If, for example,  you have multiple internal departments and need to perform a chargeback, you can create subscriptions by department or project.
- Access Control. A *subscription* is a deployment boundary for Azure resources. Every subscription is associated with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that provides administrators with the ability to set up RBAC. When designing a subscription model, be sure to consider the deployment boundary factor. Some customers have separate subscriptions for development and production, each one (from a resource perspective) being completely isolated from the other, and managed using RBAC. 
- Subscription Limits. Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations. For example, the maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription is 10. You should take those limits into consideration during the design phase. If there is a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios, then you might need additional subscriptions. If you hit a hard limit, there is no flexibility.

### Management groups
Also available to assist with managing subscriptions are management groups. *Management groups* manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions. They allow you to order your Azure resources hierarchically into collections, which provides a further level of classification above the level of subscriptions.

In the graphic below, we can see how Azure access is divided up across different business functions, such as HR marketing and IT and also per region. We could sub-divide this further and include subscriptions for Dev and QA, as well as specific teams working on our pipeline such as the security team. We could then track at a much more granular level our costs and resource usage, as well adding additional security layers and segmenting our workloads. Tightly restricting access to the production  subscriptions would further enhance our security segmentation.

You can manage your Azure subscriptions more effectively by using Azure Policy and Azure RBACs. These provide distinct governance conditions that you can apply to each management group. The resources and subscriptions you assign to a management group automatically inherit the conditions that you apply to that management group.
