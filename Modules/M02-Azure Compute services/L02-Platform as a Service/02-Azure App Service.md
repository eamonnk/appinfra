*Azure App Service* is a Platform as a Service offering on Azure, for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 

*Web App* is component of *Azure App Services*, which  is a fully managed compute platform that is optimized for hosting websites and web applications. Applications can be built and run natively in Windows or linux environments and many languages are supported for building your application such as:

Supported Languages include:
- **Node.js**
- **Java**
- **PHP**
- **Python (Preview)**
- **.NET**
- **.NET Core**
- **Ruby**

As a platform as a service offering Azure App services, offers services such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and SSL certificates


### Why use App Service?
Here are some key features of App Service:
- *Multiple languages and frameworks* - App Service supports many lanuages as listed above and also allows you to run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.
- *DevOps optimization* - Set up continuous integration and deployment with **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub**, **BitBucket**, **Docker Hub**, or **Azure Container Registry**. Promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).
- *Global scale with high availability* - Scale up or out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service SLA promises high availability.
- *Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data* - Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks.
- *Security and compliance* - App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Authenticate users with Azure Active Directory or with social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft). Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities.
- *Application templates* - Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- *Visual Studio integration* - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
- *API and mobile features* - App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
- *Serverless code* - Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure, and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses (see Azure Functions).
