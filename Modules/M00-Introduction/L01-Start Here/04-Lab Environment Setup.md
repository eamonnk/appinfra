We highly recommend that you complete the assigned hands-on lab work. To do the hands-on labs, To complete these lab exercises you will require the following items:

- a Microsoft account
- an Azure subscription

### Setup 

1. If you already have a Microsoft account that you have not already used to sign up for a free Azure trial subscription, you’re ready to get started. If not, don’t worry, you can create a new [Microsoft account](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-msa).

2. After you’ve created a Microsoft account, create your free [Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-az2) account. (If you’re not already signed into your Microsoft account, you'll need to sign in now.) 
	- Enter your cellphone number and have Microsoft send you a text message to verify your identity.
    - Enter the code you have been sent to verify your number.
    - Provide valid payment details. This is required for verification purposes only; your credit card won’t be charged for any services you use during the trial period, and the account is automatically deactivated at the end of the trial unless you explicitly decide to keep it active. For more information, see the [Azure Free Account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/) page.

### Updates to Azure 

Like many other cloud infrastructure platforms today, Azure is continuously developing updates to their services and components. If you've had your own subscriptions for any length of time, you're already aware that changes to services happen much more rapidly than with more traditional application deployment models.

Every effort will be made to update course content when there are major changes to product functionality. However, there will be occasions where course content does not exactly match the latest version of the product. In most cases, you should still be able to understand and complete the tasks. The general guidance from the Azure documentation teams is to check the documentation frequently to see what upcoming notifications have been posted or where documentation has been updated to reflect the latest changes.

 We encourage you to consult [Azure updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/) for the latest information. From there, you can research blogs and other provided resources to help you stay current in a cloud-enabled world.
