AKS is Microsoft's implementation of Kubernetes. AKS makes it easier to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure. It also reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes, by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure.


AKS manages much of the Kubernetes resources for the end user, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand without taking applications offline.

Azure AKS manages the following aspects of a Kubernetes cluster for you:

- Manages critical tasks such as health monitoring and maintenance, such as Kubernetes version upgrades and patching.
- Performs simple cluster scaling.
- Enables master nodes to be fully managed by Microsoft.
- You are responsible only for managing and maintaining the agent nodes.
- Master nodes are free, and you only pay only running agent nodes.
