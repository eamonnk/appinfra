We highly recommend that you complete the assigned hands-on lab work. A Microsoft Account and an Azure Subscription are required to complete the hands-on labs.

### Setup

1. If you have a Microsoft Account, and have not already signed up for an Azure free trial subscription, proceed to step 2 below. If you do have a Microsoft Account, create a new [Microsoft account](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-msa).

2. Sign in to your Microsoft Account and create a free [Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/edx-devops200.4x-az2) Account.
	- Enter your cellphone number and Microsoft will send you a text message (SMS) to verify your identity.
  - Enter the code sent by Microsoft to verify your cellphone number.
	- Provide valid payment details and payment method. These are required for verification purposes only. Your credit or debit card will not be charged for services you use during the free trial period. Your free trial account will be deactivated automatically at the end of the trial period, unless you specify explicitly that to keep your account active. For more information, see the page [Azure Free Account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/).

### Updates to Azure

Like many other cloud infrastructure platforms, Azure is continuously developing updates to their services and components. If you've had an subscriptions for some time, you will already be aware that changes to services happen much more rapidly than with more traditional application deployment models.

Every effort will be made to update course content when there are major changes to product functionality. However, there will be occasions where the course content does not exactly match the latest version of the product. In most cases, you should still be able to understand and complete the tasks. The general guidance from the Azure documentation team is that you should check the Azure documentation frequently, to see notifications and documentation updates which reflect the latest changes.

 We encourage you to consult [Azure updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/) for the latest information. From there, you can access blogs and other resources that are provided to help you stay current in a cloud-enabled world.

### Lab Steps
Steps for the labs are available on GitHub from the following sites, under the **Infrastructure as Code** sections.

There are many different labs present on these pages, not all of which are relevant or intended for this course. Each module includes links to the corresponding lab(s) for that module. The links provide you with access the lab(s) in each module. Follow the steps outlined for each lab task carefully.
