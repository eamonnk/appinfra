The goal of a Rugged DevOps pipeline is to allow development teams to go fast without breaking things by introducing unwanted vulnerabilities.

There are two important areas in the pipeline that are part of Rugged DevOps and not other DevOps pipelines , these are:

- Source Scanner

We will address these areas in the remainder of this lesson, the problems they represent, and how solutions can be achieved.
