After you've successfully containerized your application, you'll need ensure that you update your image regularly. This entails creating a new image for every change you make in your own code, and ensuring that all layers receive regular patching.


A large part of a container image is the base OS layer, which contains the elements of the operating system that are not shared with the container host.

The base OS layer gets updated frequently. Other layers, such as the IIS layer and ASP.NET layer in the image are also updated. Your own images are built on top of these layers, and it's up to you to ensure that they incorporate those updates.

Fortunately, the base OS layer actually consists of two separate images: a larger base layer and a smaller update layer. The base layer changes less frequently than the update layer. Updating your image's base OS layer is usually a matter of getting the latest update layer.

If you're using a Docker file to create your image, patching layers should be done by explicitly changing the image version number using the following commands:

    ```yml
    FROM microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.321
    RUN cmd /c echo hello world
    ```
    into

    ```yml
    FROM microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.693
    RUN cmd /c echo hello world
    ```

    When you build this Docker file, it now uses version 10.0.14393.693 of the image microsoft/windowsservercore.

### Latest tag
Don't be tempted to rely on the latest tag. To define repeatable custom images and deployments, you should always be explicit about the base image versions that you are using. Also, just because an image is tagged as the latest doesn't mean that it actually is the latest. The owner of the image needs to ensure this.

> **Note**: The last two segments of the version number of Windows Server Core and Nano images will match the build number of the operating system inside.
