>>Which of the following are main architectural components of Chef?<<

##Checkbox##

(choose all that apply)

[x] Chef Server
[ ] Chef Facts
[x] Chef Client
[x] Chef Workstation


[explanation]
The correct answers are Chef Server, Chef Client and Chef Workstation.

Chef Facts is an incorrect answer.

Chef Facts is not an architectural component of Chef. Chef Facts misrepresents the term 'Puppet Facts'. Puppet Facts are metadata used to determine the state of resources managed by the Puppet automation tool.

Chef has the following main architectural components. 'Chef Server' is the Chef management point. The two options for the Chef Server are 'hosted' and 'on-premises'. 'Chef Client (node)' is an agent that sits on the servers you are managing. 'Chef Workstation' is an Administrator workstation where you create Chef policies and execute management commands. You run the Chef 'knife' command from the Chef Workstation to manage your infrastructure.
